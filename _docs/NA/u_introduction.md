## Introduction 

In this chapter we will provide a general tutorial for getting your BOLOS development environment set up, followed by some detailed explanations of the various components of the BOLOS SDKs and what userspace development entails. It is assumed that you have already read the [BOLOS Platform](../b_introduction) chapter and are somewhat familiar with the BOLOS architecture.
