## Introduction

There are different release types for an application:

-   **Developer mode release**:  
    -   as an **unaudited** application  
    -   as an **audited** application  
-   **Public release** (official Ledger support)  

Ledger's release of a third party application may not be considered as any form of partnership or endorsement.

Until the application is audited by Ledger security team (Audited and Public releases), the message `Pending Ledger Review` is displayed when the application is used. The user must acknowledge this warning by pressing both buttons to use the application, which is at their own risk. Unaudited applications are considered experimental at their own risk, such application will be visible **only when the [developer mode](../../live-app/developer-mode) settings is enabled** in Ledger Live settings.

Certain applications are only visible if developer mode is enabled, not because of a lack of security review, but rather because they are considered too complex to use. For example, the mandatory compatible GUI may be missing, or perhaps the application is considered too technical for the majority of users.

Of course, an application can go through Ledger acceptance several times, according to release type.

## Your Deliverables and Ledger processes

Depending on the release type, different deliverables are required to be included in the [submission form](../deliverables-checklist).
