You have already submitted a Nano App and you want to update it. Ledger will not update your Nano App code, you are responsible for all subsequent updates following the initial release. 

For any subsequent update, you will submit a new form where you can pick and choose the parts of the App that have been updated.

The form must be submitted for all types of releases (unaudited, audited and public releases).

Every update will go through Ledger reviews:

<div class="uk-text-center" style="width:600px;">
    <a href="../images/listing-program-a2.png" style="border-bottom:none;">
        <img src="../images/listing-program-a2.png" alt="Ledger listing program reviews" />
    </a>
</div>
<!-- --------------------------------- -->

Please [fill in this form](https://ledger.typeform.com/to/ZFVKrEHN) for any updates to your Nano App code.

To have your application updates released on time, we recommend you inform Ledger as soon as possible and submit the changes at least one month before the desired release date.

Looking forward to see your updates on the Ledger Live manager!
