## Introduction

Ledger continually works to make its products and services easy and safe to use. Since the Ledger hardware wallet platform is open-source, members of the Ledger community are welcome to develop BOLOS apps. After a review and approval by Ledger, their apps can be installed through the Ledger Live Manager and used with third-party companion apps (web or desktop app).

As the companion apps are maintained by third-party members of the Ledger community, the documentation on how to use these third-party services needs to be provided during the app review process. This document presents guidelines for writing such documentation and it should be followed very carefully, as part of the app integration process.

## Documentation by Ledger

[Ledger Customer Support](https://support.ledgerwallet.com/hc/en-us) will write and publish an article ([example](https://support.ledgerwallet.com/hc/en-us/articles/360007583514-Ontology-ONT-)) that describes:
- Short introduction: what the app does, what crypto assets it can manage, using what service. Who has developed it. Ledger Nano S and Nano X supported?
- Requirements: What’s needed before starting.
- Installation instructions: How to install the app using Ledger Live.
- Next steps: link to third party documentation and where to get support.

## Writing tips

- Write short and concise sentences.
- Write clear section titles.
- Give actionable instructions: Click this, enter that. Verify this, confirm that.
- Use text formatting for UI text, example: Your device displays BTC app installed.
- Screenshots can support the instructions if the user interface is complicated.
- **Referring to the hardware wallet**: Ledger Nano S, Ledger Nano S device, device, hardware wallet, Ledger hardware wallet, Ledger device.
<i>Strictly avoid: wallet, Ledger wallet, a Ledger</i>.
- **Referring to crypto assets**: name, ticker, crypto asset(s), coin(s), cryptocurrency.
<i>Please avoid: money</i>.
