## Step by Step integration pt. 2

### Account Bridge

AccountBridge offers a generic abstraction to synchronize accounts and perform transactions.

It is designed for the end user frontend interface and is agnostic of the way it runs, has multiple implementations and does not know how the data is even stored: in fact **it's just a set of stateless functions**.

<!-- ------------- Image ------------- -->
<!-- --------------------------------- -->
![account bridge flow](../images/account-bridge-flow.png)

#### Receive

The `receive` method allows to derivate address of an account with a Nano device but also display it on the device if verify is passed in.
As you may see in `src/families/mycoin/bridge.ts`, Live Common provides a helper to implement it easily with `makeAccountBridgeReceive()`, and there is a very few reason to implement your own.

#### Synchronization

We usually group the `scanAccounts` and `sync` into the same file `js-synchronisation.ts` as they both use similar logic as a `getAccountShape` function passed to helpers.

`src/families/mycoin/js-synchronisation.ts`:

```ts
import type { Account } from "../../types";
import type { GetAccountShape } from "../../bridge/jsHelpers";
import { makeSync, makeScanAccounts, mergeOps } from "../../bridge/jsHelpers";

import { getAccount, getOperations } from "./api";

const getAccountShape: GetAccountShape = async (info) => {
  const { id, address, initialAccount } = info;
  const oldOperations = initialAccount?.operations || [];

  // Needed for incremental synchronisation
  const startAt = oldOperations.length
    ? (oldOperations[0].blockHeight || 0) + 1
    : 0;

  // get the current account balance state depending your api implementation
  const { blockHeight, balance, additionalBalance, nonce } = await getAccount(
    address
  );

  // Merge new operations with the previously synced ones
  const newOperations = await getOperations(id, address, startAt);
  const operations = mergeOps(oldOperations, newOperations);

  const shape = {
    id,
    balance,
    spendableBalance: balance,
    operationsCount: operations.length,
    blockHeight,
    myCoinResources: {
      nonce,
      additionalBalance,
    },
  };

  return { ...shape, operations };
};

const postSync = (initial: Account, parent: Account) => parent;

export const scanAccounts = makeScanAccounts(getAccountShape);

export const sync = makeSync(getAccountShape, postSync);
```

The `scanAccounts` function performs the derivation of addresses for a given `currency` and `deviceId`, and returns an Observable that will notify every `Account` that it discovered.

With the `makeScanAccounts` helper, you only have to pass a `getAccountShape` function to execute the generic scan that Ledger Live use with the correct derivation modes for <i>MyCoin</i>, and it will determine when to stop (generally as soon as an empty account was found).

The `sync` function performs one "Account synchronisation" which consists of refreshing all fields of a (previously created) Account from your api.

It is executed every 2 minutes if everything works as expected, but if it fails, a retry strategy will be executed with an increasing delay (to avoid burdening a failing API).

Under the hood of the `makeSync` helper, the returned value is an Observable of an updater function (Account=>Account), which is a pattern having some advantages:

- it avoids race conditions
- the updater is called in a reducer, and allows to produce an immutable state by applying the update to the latest account instance (with reconciliation on Ledger Live Desktop)
- it's an observable, so we can interrupt it when/if multiple updates occurs

In some cases, you might need to do a `postSync` patch to add some update logic after sync (<i>before the reconciliation that occurs on Ledger Live Desktop</i>). If this `postSync` function is complex, you should split this function in a `src/families/mycoin/js-postSyncPatch.js` file.

#### Reconciliation

Currently, Ledger Live Desktop executes this bridge in a separate thread. Thus, the "avoid race condition" aspect of sync might not be respected since the UI renderer thread does not share the same objects.
This may be improved in the future, but for updates to be reflected during sync, we implemented reconciliation in [src/reconciliation.js](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live-common/blob/master/src/reconciliation.ts), between the account that is in the renderer and the new account produced after sync.

Since we might have added some coin-specific data in `Account`, we must also reconciliate it:

`src/reconciliation`:

```ts
// import {
// ...
  fromMyCoinResourcesRaw,
// } from "./account";
// ...
// export function patchAccount(
//   account: Account,
//   updatedRaw: AccountRaw
// ): Account {
// ...
  if (
    updatedRaw.myCoinResources &&
    account.myCoinResources !== updatedRaw.myCoinResources
  ) {
    next.myCoinResources = fromMyCoinResourcesRaw(
      updatedRaw.myCoinResources
    );
    changed = true;
  }
//   if (!changed) return account; // nothing changed at all
//
//   return next;
// }
```

#### Transactions

`Transaction` objects are created from a default state (`createTransaction`), that will then be updated according to the flow and inputs of the user.

Everytime the transaction is updated through a patch (`updateTransaction`), its parameters will need to be validated to check if transaction can be signed and broadcasted (see [Validating Transactions](#validating-transactions)).

In some cases, this transaction will need to be prepared to correctly check status (`prepareTransaction`), like fetching the network fees, transforming some parameters, or setting default values, ...

`src/families/mycoin/js-transaction.ts`:

```ts
import { BigNumber } from "bignumber.js";
import type { Account } from "../../types";
import type { Transaction } from "./types";

import getEstimatedFees from "./js-getFeesForTransaction";

const sameFees = (a, b) => (!a || !b ? a === b : a.eq(b));

/**
 * Create an empty transaction
 *
 * @returns {Transaction}
 */
export const createTransaction = (): Transaction => ({
  family: "mycoin",
  mode: "send",
  amount: BigNumber(0),
  recipient: "",
  useAllAmount: false,
  fees: null,
});

/**
 * Apply patch to transaction
 *
 * @param {*} t
 * @param {*} patch
 */
export const updateTransaction = (
  t: Transaction,
  patch: $Shape<Transaction>
) => ({ ...t, ...patch });

/**
 * Prepare transaction before checking status
 *
 * @param {Account} a
 * @param {Transaction} t
 */
export const prepareTransaction = async (a: Account, t: Transaction) => {
  let fees = t.fees;

  fees = await getEstimatedFees({ a, t });

  if (!sameFees(t.fees, fees)) {
    return { ...t, fees };
  }

  return t;
};
```

#### Validating Transactions

We absolutely want to avoid users to sign transactions that do not meet the blockchain's requirements, and would be rejected - or worse - fail, risking them to loose funds.

Hence, we will validate every parameters that could lead to invalid transactions:

For instance we will check that:

- the recipient is not empty
- the recipient address is valid
- the recipient exists
- user have enough funds for the transaction
- user have enough funds to pay transaction fees
- the amount is strictly positive (avoiding zero sends)
- the minimum balance or existential deposit is respected if relevant
- etc

This validation is done everytime the user updates the transaction (any input changes) to give him immediate and contextual feedback. The status object returned by the `getTransactionStatus` follows this definition:

- `errors: { [string]: Error }`: potential error for each (user) field of the transaction
- `warnings: { [string]: Error }`: potential warning for each (user) field for a transaction
- `estimatedFees: BigNumber`: estimated total fees the tx is going to cost (in the mainAccount currency)
- `amount: BigNumber`: actual amount that the recipient will receive (in account currency)
- `totalSpent: BigNumber`: total amount that the sender will spend (in account currency)
- `recipientIsReadOnly?: boolean`: should the recipient be non editable

`errors` and `warnings` are key - value (error) objects that would have for each input (in the user perspective) the eventual error or notice that has been detected. To each key then it is expected that an input in Ledger Live Desktop and Mobile will exists to display the error.

`src/families/mycoin/js-getTransactionStatus.ts`:

```ts
import { BigNumber } from "bignumber.js";
import {
  NotEnoughBalance,
  RecipientRequired,
  InvalidAddress,
  FeeNotLoaded,
} from "@ledgerhq/errors";
import type { Account, TransactionStatus } from "../../types";
import type { Transaction } from "./types";

import { isValidAddress, specificCheck } from "./logic";
import { MyCoinSpecificError } from "./errors";

const getTransactionStatus = async (
  a: Account,
  t: Transaction
): Promise<TransactionStatus> => {
  const errors = {};
  const warnings = {};
  const useAllAmount = !!t.useAllAmount;

  if (!t.fees) {
    errors.fees = new FeeNotLoaded();
  }

  const estimatedFees = t.fees || BigNumber(0);

  const totalSpent = useAllAmount
    ? a.balance
    : BigNumber(t.amount).plus(estimatedFees);

  const amount = useAllAmount
    ? a.balance.minus(estimatedFees)
    : BigNumber(t.amount);

  if (totalSpent.gt(a.balance)) {
    errors.amount = new NotEnoughBalance();
  }

  // If MyCoin needs any specific requirement on amount for instance
  if (specificCheck(t.amount)) {
    errors.amount = new MyCoinSpecificError();
  }

  if (!t.recipient) {
    errors.recipient = new RecipientRequired();
  } else if (isValidAddress(t.recipient)) {
    errors.recipient = new InvalidAddress();
  }

  return Promise.resolve({
    errors,
    warnings,
    estimatedFees,
    amount,
    totalSpent,
  });
};

export default getTransactionStatus;
```

#### Dealing with Logic and Errors

As seen in the previous section, `getTransactionStatus` deals with errors in a Transaction, because of a wrong user input not meeting the coin logic.
Those are user-dependent errors handled in the UI for each input displayed, and are expected to happen from time to time - we are not throwing them.

But some errors can occur in a different context, and not be caused by user. Try as much as possible to handle all failing cases and throw coin-specific errors (if not generic error already exist), that you may define in an `errors.ts` file (for reusablity).

`src/families/mycoin/errors.ts`:

```ts
import { createCustomErrorClass } from "@ledgerhq/errors";

/**
 * MyCoin error thrown on a specifc check done on a transaction amount
 */
export const MyCoinSpecificError = createCustomErrorClass(
  "MyCoinSpecificError"
);
```

Add all exports to `src/errors.ts`:

```ts
// ...
export * from "./families/mycoin/errors";
```

Also, to avoid repeating code and facilitate usage of checks and constants, gather all your coin-specific logic functions in a single file (calculations, getters, boolean checks...). This will also ease maintenance, for instance when the blockchain's logic changes (constants or additional checks added).

`src/families/mycoin/logic.ts`:

```ts
import { BigNumber } from "bignumber.js";
import type { Account } from "../../types";

export const MAX_AMOUNT = 5000;

/**
 * Returns true if address is a valid md5
 *
 * @param {string} address
 */
export const isValidAddress = (address: string): boolean => {
  if (!address) return false;

  return !!address.match(/^[a-f0-9]{32}$/);
};

/**
 * Returns true if transaction amount is less than MAX AMOUNT and > 0
 *
 * @param {BigNumber} amount
 */
export const specificCheck = (amount: BigNumber): boolean => {
  return amount.gt(0) && amount.lte(MAX_AMOUNT);
};

/**
 * Returns nonce for an account
 *
 * @param {Account} a
 */
export const getNonce = (a: Account): number => {
  const lastPendingOp = a.pendingOperations[0];

  const nonce = Math.max(
    a.myCoinResources?.nonce || 0,
    lastPendingOp && typeof lastPendingOp.transactionSequenceNumber === "number"
      ? lastPendingOp.transactionSequenceNumber + 1
      : 0
  );

  return nonce;
};
```

#### Building and Signing transaction

The `Transaction` object is not exactly the transaction in the shape of the blockchain's protocol (which is generally serialized into a blob of bytes). So for convenience, you may implement a `buildTransaction` method to serialized it using <i>MyCoin</i> SDK, that could be reused for instance for estimating fees through the API.

`src/families/mycoin/js-buildTransaction.ts`:

```ts
import type { Transaction } from "./types";
import type { Account } from "../../types";

import { getNonce } from "./logic";

const getTransactionParams = (a: Account, t: Transaction) => {
  switch (t.mode) {
    case "send":
      return t.useAllAmount
        ? {
            method: "transferAll",
            args: {
              dest: t.recipient,
            },
          }
        : {
            method: "transfer",
            args: {
              dest: t.recipient,
              value: t.amount.toString(),
            },
          };
    default:
      throw new Error("Unknown mode in transaction");
  }
};

/**
 *
 * @param {Account} a
 * @param {Transaction} t
 */
export const buildTransaction = async (a: Account, t: Transaction) => {
  const address = a.freshAddress;
  const params = getTransactionParams(a, t);
  const nonce = getNonce(a);

  const unsigned = {
    address,
    nonce,
    params,
  };

  // Will likely be a call to MyCoin SDK
  return JSON.stringify(unsigned);
};
```

This `buildTransaction` function would return an unsigned transaction blob that would be signed with the <i>MyCoin</i> App on device:

`src/families/mycoin/js-signOperation.ts`:

```ts
import { BigNumber } from "bignumber.js";
import { Observable } from "rxjs";
import { FeeNotLoaded } from "@ledgerhq/errors";

import type { Transaction } from "./types";
import type { Account, Operation, SignOperationEvent } from "../../types";

import { open, close } from "../../hw";
import { encodeOperationId } from "../../operation";
import MyCoin from "./hw-app-mycoin/MyCoin";

import { buildTransaction } from "./js-buildTransaction";
import { getNonce } from "./logic";

const buildOptimisticOperation = (
  account: Account,
  transaction: Transaction,
  fee: BigNumber
): Operation => {
  const type = "OUT";

  const value = BigNumber(transaction.amount).plus(fee);

  const operation: $Exact<Operation> = {
    id: encodeOperationId(account.id, "", type),
    hash: "",
    type,
    value,
    fee,
    blockHash: null,
    blockHeight: null,
    senders: [account.freshAddress],
    recipients: [transaction.recipient].filter(Boolean),
    accountId: account.id,
    transactionSequenceNumber: getNonce(account),
    date: new Date(),
    extra: { additionalField: transaction.amount },
  };

  return operation;
};

/**
 * Adds signature to unsigned transaction. Will likely be a call to MyCoin SDK
 */
const signTx = (unsigned: string, signature: any) => {
  return `${unsigned}:${signature}`;
};

/**
 * Sign Transaction with Ledger hardware
 */
const signOperation = ({
  account,
  deviceId,
  transaction,
}: {
  account: Account,
  deviceId: *,
  transaction: Transaction,
}): Observable<SignOperationEvent> =>
  new Observable((o) => {
    async function main() {
      const transport = await open(deviceId);
      try {
        o.next({ type: "device-signature-requested" });

        if (!transaction.fees) {
          throw new FeeNotLoaded();
        }

        const unsigned = await buildTransaction(account, transaction);

        // Sign by device
        const myCoin = new MyCoin(transport);
        const r = await myCoin.signTransaction(
          account.freshAddressPath,
          unsigned
        );

        const signed = signTx(unsigned, r.signature);

        o.next({ type: "device-signature-granted" });

        const operation = buildOptimisticOperation(
          account,
          transaction,
          transaction.fees ?? BigNumber(0)
        );

        o.next({
          type: "signed",
          signedOperation: {
            operation,
            signature: signed,
            expirationDate: null,
          },
        });
      } finally {
        close(transport, deviceId);
      }
    }
    main().then(
      () => o.complete(),
      (e) => o.error(e)
    );
  });

export default signOperation;
```

The `signOperation` function returns an Observable that will notify its subscriber when the user grated the signature.
It must notify it with the signedOperation, with `signature` (generally contains the whole blob to be broadcasted) and `operation`.

This operation is an optimistic version of the `Operation` that would be displayed in the account history as a "Pending Operation" if the broadcast succeed. This pending operation is important to give feedback to the user, but may also be required for calculate the nonce (if relevant).

#### Broadcast

Once the transaction is signed, it must be broadcasted to MyCoin network. This is pretty easy if you correctly wrapped your API.

`src/families/mycoin/js-broadcast.ts`

```ts
import type { Operation, SignedOperation } from "../../types";
import { patchOperationWithHash } from "../../operation";

import { submit } from "./api";

/**
 * Broadcast the signed transaction
 * @param {signature: string, operation: string} signedOperation
 */
const broadcast = async ({
  signedOperation: { signature, operation },
}: {
  signedOperation: SignedOperation,
}): Promise<Operation> => {
  const { hash } = await submit(signature);

  return patchOperationWithHash(operation, hash);
};

export default broadcast;
```

This function must return the optimistic operation, patched with the `hash` generally provided by the network.
Once the operation is synced from <i>MyCoin</i> API, the AccountBridge will remove this optimistic operation from the `pendingOperations`.

<!--  -->
{% include alert.html style="success" text="When there are some pending operations, synchronization will occur every minutes." %}
<!--  -->

#### Estimate Max Spendable

The maximum spendable amount is the total balance in an account that is available to send in a transaction. This amount is specific to <i>MyCoin</i>, so you will need to provide this value depending on the transaction the user want to send.

See [https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360012960679-Maximum-spendable-amount](https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360012960679-Maximum-spendable-amount)

`src/families/mycoin/js-estimateMaxSpendable.ts`

```ts
import { BigNumber } from "bignumber.js";

import type { AccountLike, Account } from "../../types";
import { getMainAccount } from "../../account";

import type { Transaction } from "./types";

import { createTransaction } from "./js-transaction";
import getEstimatedFees from "./js-getFeesForTransaction";

/**
 * Returns the maximum possible amount for transaction
 *
 * @param {Object} param - the account, parentAccount and transaction
 */
const estimateMaxSpendable = async ({
  account,
  parentAccount,
  transaction,
}: {
  account: AccountLike,
  parentAccount?: Account,
  transaction?: Transaction,
}): Promise<BigNumber> => {
  const a = getMainAccount(account, parentAccount);
  const t = {
    ...createTransaction(),
    ...transaction,
    amount: a.spendableBalance,
  };

  const fees = await getEstimatedFees({ a, t });

  return a.spendableBalance.minus(fees);
};

export default estimateMaxSpendable;
```

Here, we only return the spendableBalance, but without the fees. Since Fee estimation can be used elsewhere (like in the `prepareTransaction`), you can put it's logic in a dedicated `js-getFeesForTransaction.ts` file. Here is an example for a fee fetched from network from an unsigned transaction (a bit like Polkadot), but you can also have specific calculation, with fee-per-byte value provided by the blockchain.

`src/families/mycoin/js-getFeesForTransaction.ts`:

```ts
import { BigNumber } from "bignumber.js";

import type { Account } from "../../types";
import type { Transaction } from "./types";

import { getFees } from "./api";
import { buildTransaction } from "./js-buildTransaction";

/**
 * Fetch the transaction fees for a transaction
 *
 * @param {Account} a
 * @param {Transaction} t
 */
const getEstimatedFees = async ({
  a,
  t,
}: {
  a: Account,
  t: Transaction,
}): Promise<BigNumber> => {
  const unsigned = await buildTransaction(a, t);
  const fees = await getFees(unsigned);

  return fees;
};

export default getEstimatedFees;
```

#### Testing send with CLI

Before being able to test a `send` operation with CLI you will need to bind arguments and infer a transaction from it. Since we defined a "mode" field in the transaction, this will be the only argument that will be necessary to test a send.

`src/families/mycoin/cli-transaction.ts`:

```ts
import flatMap from "lodash/flatMap";
import type { Transaction, AccountLike } from "../../types";

const options = [
  {
    name: "mode",
    type: String,
    desc: "mode of transaction: send",
  },
];

function inferTransactions(
  transactions: Array<{ account: AccountLike, transaction: Transaction }>,
  opts: Object
): Transaction[] {
  return flatMap(transactions, ({ transaction, account }) => {
    if (!transaction.family !== "mycoin") {
      throw new Error("transaction is not of type mycoin");
    }

    if (account.type === "Account" && !account.myCoinResources) {
      throw new Error("unactivated account");
    }

    return {
      ...transaction,
      family: "mycoin",
      mode: opts.mode || "send",
    };
  });
}

export default {
  options,
  inferTransactions,
};
```

Of course if <i>MyCoin</i> has more complex transactions, you can add many arguments to CLI. You can also define you own cli commands for any specific data you would like to fetch. See [Polkadot CLI commands](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live-common/blob/master/src/families/polkadot/cli-transaction.ts).

Now you can try a `getTransactionStatus` or a `send`:

```sh
ledger-live getTransactionStatus -c mycoin -i 0 --amount 0.002 --recipient 8b2d58d4a7638e9ce8a0423bff5a2de0

# TRANSACTION
# SEND  0.0002 MYC
# TO 8b2d58d4a7638e9ce8a0423bff5a2de0
# STATUS
#  amount: 0.0002 MYC
#  estimated fees: 0.00157511 MYC
#  total spent: 0.00177511 MYC

ledger-live send -c mycoin -i 0 --amount 0.002 --recipient 8b2d58d4a7638e9ce8a0423bff5a2de0

# {"type":"device-signature-requested"}
# {"type":"device-signature-granted"}
# {"id":"js:2:mycoin:0a93ac3773d54c77817e46e1007d66e3:-134ad522346bee108fa42a512788494e-OUT","hash":"134ad522346bee108fa42a512788494e","type":"OUT","blockHash":null,"blockHeight":null,"senders":["0a93ac3773d54c77817e46e1007d66e3"],"recipients":["8b2d58d4a7638e9ce8a0423bff5a2de0"],"accountId":"js:2:mycoin:0a93ac3773d54c77817e46e1007d66e3:","transactionSequenceNumber":0,"extra":{"additionalField":"20000"},"date":"2021-03-01T08:59:57.445Z","value":"177511","fee":"157511"}
```

### Currency Bridge

CurrencyBridge offers a generic abstraction (for all crypto currencies) to add accounts with a Ledger device.

It is responsible for scanning accounts for a crypto family, but also preloading any data needed for the integration to work.

<!-- ------------- Image ------------- -->
<!-- --------------------------------- -->
![currency bridge flow](../images/currency-bridge-flow.png)

#### Scanning accounts

As we have seen [Synchronization](#synchronization), the `scanAccounts`, which is part of the CurrencyBridge, share common logic with the sync function, that's why we preferably put them in a `js-synchronisation.ts` file.

The `makeScanAccounts` helper will automatically execute the default address derivation logic, but for some reason if you need to have a completely new way to scan account, you could then implement your own strategy.

#### Preload currency data (optional)

Before creating or using a currency bridge (e.g. scanning accounts, or every 2 minutes for synchronization), Ledger Live will try to preload some currency data (e.g. tokens, delegators, etc) required for live-common feature to correctly work.

This preloaded data will be stored in a persisted cache for future use, for Ledger Live to still work if temporarily offline, and speed up startup, depending on `getPreloadStrategy` (`preloadMaxAge` determines the data expiration that will trigger a refresh).

This cache contains the JSON serialized response from `preload` which is then hydrated through `hydrate` (which needs deserialization), directly after preload, or after a boot.

Live-Common features will then be able to reuse those data anywhere (e.g. validating transactions) with `getCurrentMyCoinPreloadData`, or by subscribing to `getMyCoinPreloadDataUpdates` observable.

`src/families/mycoin/preload.ts`:
```ts
import { Observable, Subject } from "rxjs";
import { log } from "@ledgerhq/logs";

import type { MyCoinPreloadData } from "./types";
import { getPreloadedData } from "./api";

const PRELOAD_MAX_AGE = 30 * 60 * 1000; // 30 minutes

let currentPreloadedData: MyCoinPreloadData = {
  somePreloadedData: {},
};

function fromHydratePreloadData(data: any): MyCoinPreloadData {
  let foo = null;

  if (typeof data === "object" && data) {
    if (typeof data.somePreloadedData === "object" && data.somePreloadedData) {
      foo = data.somePreloadedData.foo || "bar";
    }
  }

  return {
    somePreloadedData: { foo },
  };
}

const updates = new Subject<MyCoinPreloadData>();

export function getCurrentMyCoinPreloadData(): MyCoinPreloadData {
  return currentPreloadedData;
}

export function setMyCoinPreloadData(data: MyCoinPreloadData) {
  if (data === currentPreloadedData) return;

  currentPreloadedData = data;

  updates.next(data);
}

export function getMyCoinPreloadDataUpdates(): Observable<MyCoinPreloadData> {
  return updates.asObservable();
}

export const getPreloadStrategy = () => ({
  preloadMaxAge: PRELOAD_MAX_AGE,
});

export const preload = async (): Promise<MyCoinPreloadData> => {
  log("mycoin/preload", "preloading mycoin data...");

  const somePreloadedData = await getPreloadedData();

  return { somePreloadedData };
};

export const hydrate = (data: any) => {
  const hydrated = fromHydratePreloadData(data);

  log("mycoin/preload", `hydrated foo with ${hydrated.somePreloadedData.foo}`);

  setMyCoinPreloadData(hydrated);

### Cache and performance

It is important to keep in mind that all currencies work independently and that Live Common provides a common framework to synchronize accounts with a polling strategy, and that network connectivity is not always stable and optimal.

Hence, the more cryptocurrencies Ledger Live is using, the more requests and calculations are executed, which can take time.

To avoid making the same requests several times, we recommend using a local cache in your implementation (e.g. fees estimations, some currency data to preload, etc in a `src/families/mycoin/cache.ts` file.

We have a [`src/cache.ts`](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live-common/blob/master/src/cache.ts) helper for creating Least-Recently-Used caches anywhere if needed.

See for example the [Polkadot's cache implementation](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live-common/blob/master/src/families/polkadot/cache.ts).


### Front-End helpers

Live Common is mainly dedicated to be used by Ledger Live front-ends (Desktop and Mobile), so it also contains utilities for react and displaying crypto-specific data.

#### Device transaction fields

When signing a transaction, the user is shown on his device all the parameters of this transaction through multiple screen, that he must check towards the value he entered, and compare with what Ledger Live is presenting.

The list of all displayed fields on device are provided by the `getDeviceTransactionConfig` function, which must return all transaction fields for a given transaction.

`src/families/mycoin/getDeviceTransactionConfig.ts`:
```ts
import type { AccountLike, Account, TransactionStatus } from "../../types";
import type { Transaction } from "./types";
import type { DeviceTransactionField } from "../../transaction";

function getDeviceTransactionConfig({
  transaction,
  status: { estimatedFees },
}: {
  account: AccountLike;
  parentAccount?: Account;
  transaction: Transaction;
  status: TransactionStatus;
}): Array<DeviceTransactionField> {
  const fields: Array<DeviceTransactionField> = [];

  if (transaction.useAllAmount) {
    fields.push({
      type: "text",
      label: "Method",
      value: "Transfer All",
    });
  } else {
    fields.push({
      type: "text",
      label: "Method",
      value: "Transfer",
    });
    fields.push({
      type: "amount",
      label: "Amount",
    });
  }

  if (!estimatedFees.isZero()) {
    fields.push({
      type: "fees",
      label: "Fees",
    });
  }

  return fields;
}

export default getDeviceTransactionConfig;
```

### React hooks (optional / advanced)

If you are adding specific features to Ledger Live (like staking), you may need to access data through React hooks, that could provide common logic reusable for React components.

You are then free to add them in a `src/families/mycoin/react.ts` file.

See examples like sorting and filtering validators, subscribing to preloaded data observable, or waiting for a transaction to be reflected in account, in the [Polkadot React hooks](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live-common/blob/master/src/families/polkadot/react.ts).

### Icon

Icons are usually maintained by Ledger's design team, so you must first check that <i>MyCoin</i> icon is not already added in live-common, in [src/data/icons/svg](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live-common/tree/master/src/data/icons/svg). It contains cleaned-up versions of Cryptocurrency Icons from [cryptoicons.co](http://cryptoicons.co/), organized by ticker.

If you need to add your own, they must respect those requirements:
- Clean SVG with **only** `<path>` elements representing the crypto
- Size and viewport must be `24x24`
- Icon should be `18x18` and centered / padded
- Flat-styled, and must respect crypto color scheme (filled)
- No background or decorative shape added
- No `<g>` or `transform`, `style` attributes...

Name should be the coin's ticker (e.g. `MYC.svg`) and must not conflict with an existing coin or token.

When building live-common, a [script](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live-common/blob/master/scripts/buildReactIcons.js) automatically converts them to React and React Native components.
