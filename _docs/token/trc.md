## How to request a token addition

### 1. Is my TRC10 or TRC20 token listed?

First, make sure your token isn’t already listed by checking this table of the [supported crypto-assets](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live-desktop/blob/develop/cryptoassets.md).

<!--  -->
{% include alert.html style="tip" text="The list of supported assets on the <a href='https://www.ledger.com/supported-crypto-assets/'>website</a> is managed through an internal Ledger process. For the moment it’s difficult to guarantee the exact mapping between tokens available on Ledger Live and listed on the website." %}

### What will Ledger do?

We will review the list of tokens on a bi-montly basis and will apply our own internal signature process. Once signed, the new tokens will become available after a Ledger Live update. Ledger reserves the right to decide which token will be listed.
